      description: |
        The wide expanse of 82nd Avenue stretches north and south, cracked
        asphalt dotted with burned-out cars and improvised barricades.
        Strip malls line both sides, their signs shot out or stolen.
        This is the spine of Felony Flats — everything flows through here.
        The air smells of diesel smoke and something chemical.

        A gutted strip mall with a collapsed awning. The old signage
        is unreadable beneath layers of graffiti. A nail salon, a pawn
        shop, and a check-cashing place — all stripped to the studs.
        Scavengers pick through what remains with practiced efficiency.

        Foster Road cuts diagonally through the grid, lined with dead
        trees and collapsed power lines. The pavement is buckled from
        years of freeze-thaw without maintenance. A faded mural on a
        brick wall depicts a Portland that no longer exists.
        The road narrows as it heads south toward the edge of the zone.

        The overgrown banks of Johnson Creek form a hidden world beneath
        tangles of blackberry and alder. The water runs brown and slow.
        Makeshift camps are tucked into the brush — tarps and pallets
        arranged with survivalist ingenuity. Cookfire smoke drifts

        The old Jade District still clings to life. Food stalls built
