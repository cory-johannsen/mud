        The cracked asphalt of the old Tualatin Valley Highway stretches east
        toward Aloha, littered with burned-out cars and toppled power poles.
        To the west, the road narrows as crude barricades mark the edge of
        the Kingdom of Hillsboro. Blue-and-white banners snap in the wind.

        What was once a server monitoring center now serves as the Kingdom's

        and the Kingdom loses its claim to legitimacy.
