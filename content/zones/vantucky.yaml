        The road crosses an invisible line where the Couve ends and Vantucky begins.
        Burned tires and razor wire mark the boundary. A hand-painted sign reads
        "WELCOME TO FREE TERRITORY" with a crude skull beneath it.
        The pavement is cracked and patched with gravel. Pickup trucks rust in driveways.

        A commercial strip of gutted big-box stores and collapsed fast food joints.
        The parking lots have been converted into militia drill grounds and swap meets.
        Shell casings crunch underfoot. A faded Walmart sign hangs by one bolt,
        swinging in the wind with a metallic groan.

        Once a quiet suburban neighborhood, the Orchards has been carved into
        fortified compounds. Chain-link fences topped with concertina wire
        surround clusters of houses. Old fruit trees grow wild between the lots,
        their branches heavy with unpicked apples rotting on the ground.
        The smell of fermenting fruit mixes with wood smoke.

        Militia flags fly from improvised poles. Guard towers fashioned from

        A hand-cranked siren sits atop the nearest tower, ready to sound the alarm.

        The highway overpass is a notorious ambush point. Rusted guardrails
        offer minimal cover. Abandoned vehicles have been pushed to the sides
        to create a kill zone. Shell casings and old bloodstains mark the concrete.

        Fishing boats are chained to makeshift docks along the muddy shore.
        A few families have set up permanent camps in the parking structure,
        trading smoked fish and river salvage. The water is brown but the fish

        A watchtower made from a grain silo provides a commanding view of the

        Ammunition is sold by the round. A hand-lettered sign reads
