        The eastern end of the Aloha Neutral Zone opens onto the cracked
        asphalt of TV Highway. A makeshift barricade of wrecked cars and
        chain-link fencing marks the border. Faded signs warn travelers
        to check weapons at the gate. Beyond the barricade, Beaverton sprawls.

        A sandbagged guard station occupies what was once a gas station canopy.
        The roof provides shelter from the rain, and a fire barrel crackles
        in the corner. Sentries watch the eastern approach with practiced
        vigilance. A logbook sits on a plywood desk, recording every arrival.

        The intersection of TV Highway and 185th Avenue is a wide, windswept
        crossroads. Traffic lights dangle uselessly from corroded poles.
        Foot traffic flows in all directions — traders heading to the bazaar,
        refugees seeking the camp, smugglers slipping toward the warehouses.

        An open-air market sprawls across what was once a shopping center
        parking lot. Tarps and salvaged awnings stretch between poles, shading
        rows of blankets and folding tables piled with scavenged goods.
        The air is thick with the smell of grilled rat and diesel smoke.

        The western guard station mirrors its eastern counterpart — sandbags,
        fire barrel, plywood desk. A hand-painted sign reads "LEAVING NEUTRAL
        ZONE — ARM YOURSELVES." The sentries here watch the Hillsboro road
        with grim attention, wary of raiding parties from the west.
