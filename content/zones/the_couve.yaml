        The southern anchor of the old Interstate Bridge rises from the Columbia River
        in a lattice of rusted steel and crumbling concrete. The bridge deck stretches
        north into Washington, swaying faintly in the river wind. South, the road
        descends toward the Oregon side and the ruins of Northeast Portland.
        Toll booths have been converted into guard shacks by whoever controls the crossing today.

        The old shopping center has been gutted and rebuilt into a pirate haven.
        Houseboats and pontoon rafts cluster along the shore, lashed together with
        cable and chain. The smell of smoked salmon and diesel hangs in the air.
        River pirates lounge on deck chairs, watching the Columbia roll past.
        A hand-painted sign reads "JANTZEN BEACH FREE PORT — NO LAWS, NO REFUNDS."

        The Columbia River waterfront has been rebuilt into a crude port.
        Wooden docks jut into the current, creaking under loads of salvage and trade
        goods. Warehouses with corrugated walls shelter barter markets. Upriver,
        the silhouette of the railroad bridge disappears into permanent fog.
        A ferry made from a welded-together school bus floats at anchor.

        workshop. The chain restaurant warlord who controls this location demands
