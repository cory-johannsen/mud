      title: "Pioneer Courthouse Square"
      description: |
        You stand in the ruins of what was once Pioneer Courthouse Square.
        The iconic brick amphitheater is cracked and overgrown with black moss.
        The sky is a permanent grey. Rain falls sideways.
        A weathered sign reads "Portland's Living Room" — the irony is not lost.

      title: "Morrison Bridge Approach"
      description: |
        The western approach to the Morrison Bridge stretches before you.
        Twisted rebar juts from crumbling concrete. The Willamette churns below,
        dark and swollen with decades of unfiltered runoff.
        Abandoned vehicles form a rusted barricade across the bridge deck.

      title: "Broadway Ruins"
      description: |
        The shells of old theaters and department stores line what was once Broadway.
        Faded marquees hang at broken angles. A colony of crows watches from
        the gutted upper floors. Glass crunches under every step.

      title: "Market District"
      description: |
        Makeshift stalls cobbled from salvage line the broken street.
        The smell of wood smoke and something cooking drifts between
        tarps strung between lampposts. This is the closest thing
        to civilization left in the core.

      title: "Waterfront Trail"
      description: |
        A cracked pathway follows the river's edge. The Willamette laps
        against collapsed seawalls. Rusted sculptures from the old waterfront
        park lean at impossible angles. Upstream, the skeletal remains
        of the Steel Bridge disappear into the fog.

      title: "Transit Mall"
      description: |
        The once-bustling transit corridor is silent. Overhead wires hang
        in tangled loops. A MAX light rail car sits derailed and gutted,
        its windows long since shattered. Weeds push through every crack
        in the concrete platform.

      description: |
        The geometric water feature is dry and filled with debris.
        The glass canopy overhead is miraculously intact, though stained
        with years of grime. It offers rare shelter from the endless rain.
        Scorch marks on the concrete hint at past conflicts.

      description: |
        The intersection of Burnside and the old Broadway is a no-man's land.
        The street is wide and exposed. Burnt-out storefronts stare with
        empty window-eyes. Graffiti in fading neon paint marks territorial
        boundaries of factions long since scattered.

      description: |
        You descend into the subterranean transit station via crumbling stairs.
        Emergency lighting flickers in sickly yellow. The platform is flooded
        ankle-deep. Somewhere in the dark tunnels, water drips in an
        irregular rhythm that sounds almost like breathing.

      description: |
        The old federal courthouse looms above, its neoclassical columns
        chipped and stained. The broad stone steps serve as a gathering
        point for scavengers trading rumors and salvage.
        Someone has carved "NO LAW" into the granite above the entrance.
