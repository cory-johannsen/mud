        Powell Boulevard dead-ends here at a collapsed overpass. Rebar fingers
        claw upward from shattered concrete. To the north, the last ragged
        edge of the Flats gives way to industrial sprawl. South, corrugated
        warehouses stretch in long rows toward the river. The air smells of
        rust and diesel that seeped into the ground decades ago.
