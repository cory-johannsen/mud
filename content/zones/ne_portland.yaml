        The once-vibrant arts district is a riot of color gone wrong.
        Murals peel from crumbling walls, their hopeful messages mocking the present.
        Feral gallery-gangs have claimed the storefronts, decorating their turf
        with salvaged installations and the bones of trespassers.
