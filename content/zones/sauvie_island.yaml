      description: |
        The southern end of the old Sauvie Island Bridge groans under your weight.
        Rusted cables sway in the river wind. Below, the Multnomah Channel churns
        grey and cold. Sandbags and razor wire mark the island's first line of defense.
        The mainland sprawls behind you to the southeast, smoke rising from the waterfront.

        A crude checkpoint blocks the road just past the bridge. Concrete barriers
        funnel traffic through a single lane watched by armed sentries. A hand-painted
        sign reads "ISLAND COUNCIL TERRITORY — STATE YOUR BUSINESS."
        Shell casings litter the pavement.

        The main road cuts through overgrown fields and collapsed utility poles.
        Cracked asphalt stretches in both directions, patched here and there with
        packed gravel. Irrigation ditches run along both shoulders, carrying
        brown water toward the farms. The air smells of wet earth and woodsmoke.

        The soil here is dark and rich, tended by hand. Scarecrows made from

        A weathered barn sits at the field's edge, its red paint long faded to grey.

        Tangled rows of blackberry and marionberry bushes run wild across

        A two-story farmhouse stands stubbornly against time and weather.
        The porch sags but holds. Smoke drifts from a chimney patched with
        sheet metal. Muddy boots line the front steps. Through a window
        you can see oil lamps burning on a kitchen table covered in seed catalogs.

        Chickens wander in and out through gaps in the siding.
