      description: |
        The western end of the Ross Island Bridge touches down on cracked
        concrete pilings sunk into the island's eastern shore. The bridge
        deck behind you is a gauntlet of missing sections and buckled steel.
        Ahead, a crude barricade of wrecked cars and chain-link fencing
        funnels all traffic toward a toll gate. Spray-painted warnings
        promise violence to anyone who runs the checkpoint.

      description: |
        A ramshackle checkpoint blocks the road west. Corrugated metal
        walls funnel travelers through a narrow gap where a heavy chain
        can be dropped at a moment's notice. Toll prices are scratched
        into a sheet of plywood — the rates change daily, always upward.
        Dented toll tokens litter the mud at your feet.

        A potholed road cuts west from the toll gate into the island's
        interior. Rusted guardrails line one side; the other drops away
        to a tangle of blackberry brambles and collapsed retaining walls.
        Tire tracks in the mud suggest regular traffic — the gravel pit
        still draws workers and scavengers alike.

        A narrow strip of gravel and driftwood lines the island's

        Bridge pilings rise overhead like the legs of some concrete
        giant. Small fires have been lit here recently — charred

        A muddy trail follows the island's southern perimeter, weaving
        between riverside willows and heaps of industrial debris. The
        water is close enough to touch. Old tires and shopping carts
        protrude from the shallows. The path is well-worn — hermits
        use it to move unseen between the shore and the interior.

        The island's southern bank faces the open river. The current
        is strong here, churning around exposed rocks and half-submerged
        logs. A crude dock made of lashed pallets extends a few meters
        into the water. Someone has tied a rowboat to it — the oars
        are missing, but the hull looks sound enough.

      description: |
        A depression in the rocky shore traps river water at low tide,
        creating a murky pool teeming with crawdads and small fish.
        The rocks around the edge are slick with algae. Hermits have
        laid crude fish traps here — woven baskets weighted with stones.
        The smell of brine and decay hangs in the still air.

        A makeshift shelter built from driftwood and river debris clings

        several people live here. A fire pit smolders with damp coals.

        The island's interior is choked with vegetation gone feral.
        Blackberry canes form impenetrable walls. Ivy has swallowed
        whole structures — only corners and rooflines hint at what
        lies beneath. The canopy overhead blocks most light, creating
        a green twilight. Movement in the undergrowth could be rats,
        could be something larger.

        Hidden deep in the overgrowth, a clearing has been carved from

        form a small compound. Wind chimes made of scrap metal and bone
        hang from the branches. The hermits here trade in river fish,
        salvage, and rumors. They trust no one from the bridge.

        A narrow opening in a moss-covered rock face leads into darkness.
        The stone around the entrance is scored with old tool marks —
        this was once part of the quarry operation. Cool air flows out,
        carrying the smell of damp earth and standing water. Hermit
        markings scratched into the rock warn outsiders away.

        The cave opens into a low chamber carved from compressed gravel
        and sandstone. Water drips from the ceiling, pooling in shallow
        depressions. Old mining equipment rusts in the corners — picks,
        buckets, a section of rail track going nowhere. Someone has
        stacked supplies against the far wall under a sheet of plastic.

        To the east, the bridge stretches toward SE Industrial.
        The wind is fierce up here, whipping grit into your eyes.

        You stand at the rim of the Ross Island gravel pit, a vast
        excavation that dominates the island's center. The walls drop
        away steeply — fifty feet of layered sediment and exposed rock.
        Heavy machinery rusts at the bottom. A switchback road carved
        into the pit wall provides the only vehicle access. The scale
        of the operation is staggering, even in ruin.

        The massive excavation is a world unto itself. Terraced walls
        of grey stone and compacted earth rise on all sides. At the
        center, a cluster of prefab buildings serves as the pit boss's
        domain — part office, part throne room. Workers sort gravel
        by hand, filling buckets that get hauled up the switchback
        road. The operation is brutal but functional.

        The lowest point of the pit is a flat expanse of crushed stone

        nowhere. The walls tower overhead, cutting off the wind but
        trapping the cold. Workers chip at the rock face with hand
        tools, filling bags of aggregate for the pit boss's trade
        caravans. The work never stops.

        gravel shore. Fish thrive here, drawn by the insects that
        breed in the still water. Hermits fish from the banks with

        From here it looks almost peaceful, if you squint. The shore
