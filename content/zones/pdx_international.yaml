        The cracked expanse of Airport Way stretches east toward the looming
        silhouette of PDX International. Abandoned cars rust in the median,
        their doors flung open by long-gone refugees. To the west, the
        overpass connects back toward the I-205 corridor and NE Portland.

        Airport Way continues eastward past collapsed sound barriers and

        section into a shrine. Candles flicker in concentric circles around
        a central altar made from stacked luggage. Faded boarding passes
        are pinned to every surface. The zealots kneel here, murmuring
        prayers to the sky gods for the return of flight.
