      description: |
        The crumbling westbound on-ramp of Interstate 84 marks the edge of Troutdale.
        Wind screams through the concrete barriers, carrying grit and the smell of the river.
        Rusted guardrails lean outward like broken teeth. To the west, the freeway
        disappears toward the distant haze of Vancouver.

        A tangled interchange where old highway ramps spiral around each other
        like concrete serpents. Faded green signs point toward PDX International

        The massive Columbia Gorge Outlets sprawl across cracked asphalt,
        a cathedral of consumerism reduced to hollow storefronts and shattered glass.
        Wind whistles through empty doorframes. Faded brand logos cling to facades

        The main road through Troutdale is cracked and heaved by decades
        of freeze-thaw cycles. A few structures still stand along the strip:
        a gutted gas station, a collapsed fast-food joint, a surprisingly
        intact brick building with boarded windows. Wind funnels down the
        street corridor like a river of air.

        The Sandy River rushes over a rocky ford, swollen with glacial melt

        Massive Douglas firs tower overhead, their branches creaking in the wind.

        Fire rings are blackened with recent use — someone camps here.

        You stand at the edge of Crown Point, hundreds of feet above the
        Columbia River. The wind here is ferocious, a living force that
        tears at clothing and steals breath. The view is staggering:
        the gorge stretches east in layers of basalt and green, the river
        a silver ribbon far below. The ruined Vista House crumbles behind you.

        The great waterfall plunges six hundred feet down the basalt cliff face,

        spans the lower cascade, cracked but still passable. Pilgrims leave
        offerings on the rocks — bottle caps, wire flowers, carved stones.
        The mist is constant and cold.

        progress. The walls are smooth, carved by millennia of wind erosion.

        Now it serves as Troutdale's main settlement. Cooking fires burn in
