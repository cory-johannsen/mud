description: |
  The sun-bleached ruins of Los Angeles and San Diego — endless sprawl turned
  into endless wasteland. The old glamour is gone but the hustle remains. You
  grew up fast-talking and fast-moving under skies that never rain, trading on
  wits and connections in a land where nothing is real.
